# Bare_Minimum_R
As part of Bare_Minimum_R course by Dean Lee, I did some basic exploratory data analysis on some biological datasets. In this repository, I include the files I worked on. 

## Esophageal Cancer Dataset
In this project, I worked on a dataset called `esoph`.

This dataset which contains information about alcohol and tobacco consumption along with the age group corresponding to each combination of these consumptions. The end result of this EDA was to get the lowest vs highest risk associated with diffrent combinations of the variables involved.

To get insightful conclusions, I utilized several graphical plots including: **bar plots**, **scatter plots**, and **box plots**. Besides, I used several statistical concepts such as **frequency**, **sum**, and **mean**.

## Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia RNA-seq Gene Expression Dataset
In this project, I worked on an RNA sequence showing the expression of some genes in several cancer cell lines. This dataset was taken from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). It is called `CCLE RNAseq gene expression data fpr 1019 cell lines`.
