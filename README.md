# Bare_Minimum_R
As part of Bare_Minimum_R course by Dean Lee, I did some basic exploratory data analysis on some biological datasets. In this repository, I include the files I worked on. 

## Esophageal Cancer
In this project, I worked on a dataset called `esoph`.

This dataset which contains information about alcohol and tobacco consumption along with the age group corresponding to each combination of these consumptions. The end result of this EDA was to get the lowest vs highest risk associated with diffrent combinations of the variables involved.
